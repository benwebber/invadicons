# Invadicons

Invadicons are 8-bit avatars that look kind of like Space Invaders.

This is an open-source clone of [Gravatar's retro avatars](https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/images/#default-image), written in Python. Invadicons are served by a [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) app.


## Examples

These are some of the avatars you get when you hash `00000000000000000000000000000000` repeatedly.
